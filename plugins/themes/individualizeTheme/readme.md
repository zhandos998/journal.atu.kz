# Develop and Contribute

This theme uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build CSS/JS assets.

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the following commands to sync CSS/JS assets with Vite's HMR server while editing the theme.


```bash
npm run start
```

Two bundles are built. One for the main site (`src/main.js`) and a smaller bundle for the PDF and HTML galley pages (`src/galley.js`).

## Package and Release

Update the version in the `package.json` file.

```
  "version": "<version>",
```

Update the version and date in the `version.xml` file.

```
  <release>[version]</release>
  <date>[YYYY-MM-DD]</date>
```

Build the assets for distribution.

```bash
npm run build
```

Create a `.tar.gz` package of this theme by running the following command in the directory above the theme.

```
tar -czf individualizeTheme-<version>.tar.gz --exclude-ignore=.tarignore individualizeTheme
```

Replace the `<version>` with the correct version, such as `1.2.0.0`.
